// Similar to if... Used when we have to store the value or the condition or there is no longer code

let age = 18
let license = true
// let result = age > 15? "Can drive":"Cant drive"

// Complex eg
let result = age >= 18? license == true ?"Can drive":"License issue":"Age issue"

console.log(result)
